## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (preferably Python 3.x)
- Git

## Setup

1. **Clone the Project Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your project's Git repository.

2. **Navigate the project directory**

```bash
  cd <project-directory>
```
Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of your project directory.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
   python -m venv venv
```

This command will create a directory named `venv` containing a Python interpreter and a copy of the standard Python library.

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
On Windows:
```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Linux or MacOS
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
You should see `(venv)` in your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is activated.

5. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace `requirements.txt` with the name of your project's requirements file.
